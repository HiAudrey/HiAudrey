## My Story

I used to be a **data analyst** passionate about turning data into real-world impact. I worked on **data collection, cleaning, dashboarding, business performance analysis, predictive modeling, and data-driven storytelling** ‚Äî transforming complex datasets into actionable insights.

These skills shaped how I see the world: I love **uncovering hidden patterns**, finding **fundamental reasons**, and providing **thoughtful solutions**. Over time, technical work felt too narrow ‚Äî it couldn‚Äôt satisfy my curiosity about human experience.

I began to **travel, study, and write**. I became a **blogger and a novel author**, observing life as both participant and witness. Eventually, I was called to found **[Eudaimon](https://EudaimonAI.org)**, a nonprofit organization and a **safe space for individuals to reclaim their voice**. I‚Äôm now developing a **free guided educational chatbot** to provide mental health support for those who need it but can‚Äôt afford traditional counseling.

If you‚Äôd like to chat about potential collaborations, feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/weimengduan).
