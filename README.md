## 💫 My Story
I used to be a data analyst passionate about turning data into real-world impact. I worked on data collection, quality assessment and cleaning, dashboarding and reporting, business performance analysis, predictive modeling, and data-driven storytelling — transforming complex datasets into actionable insights.

These skills shaped how I see the world: I love uncovering hidden patterns, finding the fundamental reasons behind what people see on the surface, and providing thoughtful solutions. Over time, the technical work felt too narrow — it couldn’t satisfy my curiosity about human experience.

I began to travel, study, and write. I became a blogger and a novel author, observing life both as a participant and as a witness. Eventually, I was called to found [**Eudaimon**](https://EudaimonAI.org), a nonprofit organization and a safe space for individuals to reclaim their voice. I’m now developing a free guided educational chatbot to provide mental health support for those who need it but can’t afford traditional counseling.

If you’d like to chat about potential collaborations, feel free to connect with me on [**LinkedIn**](https://linkedin.com/in/weimengduan#gh-light-mode-only).
